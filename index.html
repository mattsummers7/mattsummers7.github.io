									<h2>Haptic Feedback Dissertation</a></h2>
									<p>In the final year of my degree my dissertation was on haptic feedback and its impact on the players gameplay experience. 
										For this project I worked in VR using the Unity XR Toolkit to create a level designed to test how much haptic feedback has an 
										impact on player's immersion.
									</p>
								</header>

								<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
								<h4>Unity</h4>
								<h4>Virtual Reality</h4>
								<h4>GitHub</h4>

								<br />

								<p>A VR bank heist level was created for the purpose of the dissertation, here is a video of the level:</p>
								<iframe width="1080" height="615w" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDWFEN63_cE"> </iframe>
								<br><br />
								<p>
								</p>
								<p>The level incorporated various puzzles and scenarios, such as wall climbing and challenging jumps, 
									to provide diverse gameplay experiences. Each element was crafted to evaluate how haptic feedback influences player engagement and immersion. <br />
									For a more detailed technical explanation and further information about the project, please click the link below to read the full dissertation.

									<h2>WarLocks</a></h2>
									<p>WarLocks is a split-screen PVP multiplayer game created by TechJam. TechJam was a 13 person group of students who came together to create a game together.
										WarLocks allows players to pick one of four elemental wizards and battle it out using unique elemental spells and collectable ultimate abilities
										to fight other players in a variety of different maps.

								<iframe width="1080" height="615w" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FrH-C39fS0c"> </iframe>
								<br><br />
								<p>In this collaborative project, our team were focused on creating an engaging, multiplayer experience. 
									<br><br />
									My primary responsibilities were developing player movement, camera controls, and movement abilities. I designed and implemented, 
									from scratch, custom player movement scripts from scratch using the New Unity Input System, allowing for fully adjustable speed and jump heights. 
									I also created unique movement abilities for different player classes.
									<br><br />
									I was also supporting the team by brainstorming ideas to bring the game to life as well as supporting the team with bug fixes across the whole game.

									<h2>VR Relaxation Puzzle Game</a></h2>
									<p>For this task I wanted to create a game that was both engaging and relaxing. I created a VR puzzle game in which players 
										solve different puzzles to complete a constellation in space.
									</p>
								</header>
								<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
								<h4>Unity</h4>
								<h4>Virtual Reality</h4>
								<h4>GitHub</h4>
								<br />
								<p>Designed to immerse players in a serene environment, this demo highlights the potential for creating calming and engaging VR experiences.</p>
								<iframe width="1080" height="615w" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CgYQwvon2bs"> </iframe>
								<br><br />
								<p>Through research I had the idea to create a VR puzzle experience that lets players calmly solve a puzzle to create constellation to decorate their hub space.
								</p>
								
								<p>The experience so far includes three unique puzzles: a 'Simon Says' game, a search and find game and a laser destruction game. 
									<br><br />
									The game makes full use of the XR Interaction Toolkit with grabbable objects and sockets as well multiple game managers that work 
									together to provide a smooth and bug free player experience.

								<p>This game features combat, consumables, controller support, and a boss battle. My contributions focused on developing shaders for the game. 
									I created unique shaders for players and enemies to visually represent damage and healing effects when potions are consumed. This project was 
									developed using Python and PyASGE.
